# Parent Build Files

This repository contains the parent files that manage global
properties for the Nuvla component builds. There is a master `pom.xml`
file for maven and a root `project.clj` file for leiningen.

These artifacts are updated and released as necessary.  Each has an
independent version number.  The release processes are documented in
each subdirectory.
