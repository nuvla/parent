## Contributing

Before adding new dependencies or removing existing ones, discuss with
other developers, especially from those that depend on this
`project.clj` file.  Generally try to minimize the number of
dependencies and choose a single library for a given functionality.

When updating versions, use your best judgement on whether the change
is likely to cause an issue with other components.  If there is a
doubt, then discuss the changes.  In any case, test changes with other
components when possible.

Please keep the dependencies in the `project.clj` file
alphabetized. Ensure that the file uses the standard clojure
formatting (with aligned maps) provided by the IntelliJ Cursive
plugin.
