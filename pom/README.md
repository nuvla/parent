# Parent POM File for Nuvla Maven Builds

This provides a parent POM file for all of the Nuvla maven builds.
All Nuvla maven project must reference (directly or indirectly) a
consistent, release version of this POM file.  For example,

```xml
<parent>
  <groupId>sixsq.nuvla.parent</groupId>
  <artifactId>pom</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
</parent>
```

Normally, this reference appears in the top `pom.xml` file in a
repository.
